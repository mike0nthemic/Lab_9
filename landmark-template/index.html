                        <p>
                            There is a spot in Glamis that is known by the people that visit as The Hill. The Hill is literally a big sand dune that many of the visitors come to drive up this really steep hill as fast as they could and come back down. I've never personally driven up the hill but the vehicle we had a the time did not have enough power and was too heavy to drive up without rolling backwards. I will say from a distance the hill does not look very steep and tall but once you try going up it you'll realize how steep and tall it is. But it is still fun to watch people try to test the limits of their vechicles by driving up it.

                        <p>
                            The Drag Strip is a spot that is located near the base of The Hill. Where people would take turns trying to go as fast as they can down a long strip that is outlined by people spectating these vechicles going as fast as they can. I've really enjoyed watching the different vechicles that go down the strip because they're mostly custom built vehicles that are built for speed and some even have so much torque that they do a wheelie when they launch their vechicle.

                            The community that rides out there are the nicest and most welcoming people you'll ever meet. Everyone that goes out there to have a good time with friends and family. Despite the apperance of these vehicles with their agressive looking geometry they are drivin by nice and down to earth people. Some of the people that drive these vehicles too are professional desert races.

                        Glamis is home to the Imperial Sand Dunes that people come to drive thier offroad vehicles in the sand. There are various types of vehicles driven there like ATVs, Sand Rails, Buggies, and sometimes custom built vehicles made specifically for the sand. Driving in the sand dunes is quite different from driving on the road or the back woods. The best way I can describe driving through the sand dunes is that your carving on the side of the dune like surfer carves through a wave. However, you need to maintain your momentum because if you stop midway you'll sink in the sand and possibly roll over. Despite the learning curve of how to drive in the dunes its still fun and even visit to spectate.
